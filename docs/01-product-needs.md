- Pitch availability represented by Slots (start/end UTC) with capacity 1 match.

## Internationalization & Time Zones
- All stored in UTC; client displays in user locale/time zone.
- Text content prepared for localization (resource keys on UI layer â€” future).

## Data Freshness / Live
- Match events posted in real time; standings recomputed after each status change to InProgress or Final.
- Webhooks / SignalR (future iteration) for push updates.

## Non-Functional Needs
